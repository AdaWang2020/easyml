## Overview

In this vignette, we demonstrate the power of easyml using a Prostate Cancer dataset.

## Load the data

First we load the easymlpy package and the Prostate Cancer dataset.



```python
from easymlpy.datasets import load_prostate
from easymlpy import support_vector_machine

%matplotlib inline
```

    /Users/paulhendricks/miniconda3/envs/easyml/lib/python3.5/site-packages/sklearn/cross_validation.py:44: DeprecationWarning: This module was deprecated in version 0.18 in favor of the model_selection module into which all the refactored classes and functions are moved. Also note that the interface of the new CV iterators are different from that of this module. This module will be removed in 0.20.
      "This module will be removed in 0.20.", DeprecationWarning)



```python
prostate = load_prostate()
print(prostate.head())
```

## Train a supprt vector machine model

To run an `easy_support_vector_machine` model, we pass in the following parameters:

* the data set `prostate`,
* the name of the dependent variable e.g. `lpsa`,
* whether to run a gaussian or a binomial model,
* which variables to exclude from the analysis,
* which variables are categorical variables; these variables are not scaled, if `preprocess_scale` is used,
* the random state,
* whether to display a progress bar,
* how many cores to run the analysis on in parallel.


```python
# Analyze data
results = support_vector_machine.easy_support_vector_machine(prostate, 'lpsa',
                                                             n_samples=10, n_divisions=10, 
                                                             n_iterations=10, progress_bar=False, 
                                                             random_state=12345, n_core=1)
```

## Assess results

Now letâ€™s assess the results of the `easy_support_vector_machine` model.

### Predictions: ROC Curve

We can examine both the in-sample and out-of-sample ROC curve plots for one particular trian-test split determined by the random state and determine the Area Under the Curve (AUC) as a goodness of fit metric. Here, we see that the in-sample AUC is higher than the out-of-sample AUC, but that both metrics indicate the model fits relatively well.


```python
results.plot_predictions_single_train_test_split_train()
```

    /Users/paulhendricks/miniconda3/envs/easyml/lib/python3.5/site-packages/scipy/linalg/basic.py:884: RuntimeWarning: internal gelsd driver lwork query error, required iwork dimension not returned. This is likely the result of LAPACK bug 0038, fixed in LAPACK 3.2.2 (released July 21, 2010). Falling back to 'gelss' driver.

### Metrics: AUC

We can examine both the in-sample and out-of-sample AUC metrics for `n_divisions` train-test splits (ususally defaults to 1,000). Again, we see that the in-sample AUC is higher than the out-of-sample AUC, but that both metrics indicate the model fits relatively well.

## Discuss

In this vignette we used `easyml` to easily build and evaluate a support vector machine model using a Prostate Cancer dataset.
