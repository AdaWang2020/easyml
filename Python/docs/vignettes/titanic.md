## Overview

In this vignette, we demonstrate the power of easyml using the popular Titanic dataset.

## Load the data

Install the titanic package from CRAN. This package contains datasets providing information on the fate of passengers on the fatal maiden voyage of the ocean liner “Titanic”, with variables such as economic status (class), sex, age and survival. These data sets are often used as an introduction to machine learning on Kaggle. More details about the dataset can be found there.



```python
import easymlpy
